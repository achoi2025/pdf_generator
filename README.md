## About The Project ðŸ“š

The tool is created to **support teachers** who need to send out different types of awards to students. The template could be **easily manipulated** using the buttons implemented using GUI. 

Here's why you should use this tool:
* Making the awards for all medals is just burdensome. Use this tool to quickly generate memorable digital awards.
* It's user-friendly. Overwhelmed with thousands of buttons? This one only has eight...!
* Memory-effective. You don't need extra space in your computer to run this program.
